# Migration

* If you are looking to migrate from [Akka Persistence JDBC](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-jdbc/current/migration.html), you should upgrade to v5.1.x before attempting to migrate to Pekko's equivalent.
* The [Pekko Migration Guide](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/1.0/project/migration-guides.html) is a good summary of the changes that you need to make when switching from Akka to Pekko.
